Manus, the new AI product everyone’s talking about, lives up to the hype🔥

This is the AI agent we were promised:
Deep Research + Operator + Computer Use + Lovable + Memory.

I asked it to “conduct a professional analysis of Tesla stock,” and it delivered about two weeks’ worth of professional-level work in just one hour! 🤯

The company is based in China and Singapore. The founder says it uses Claude Sonnet 3.5 for execution and a post-trained Qwen for planning.

Yichao, the founder, is saying:
“Agentic capabilities might be more of an alignment problem than a foundational capability issue.”
