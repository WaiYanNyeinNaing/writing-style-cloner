Honest opinion after trying Manus AI for the last 3 days, here’s the good and the bad.  

Good:  
- The research it does on the internet and the reports it generates are incredible.  
- Its ability to run scripts behind the scenes to execute tasks is impressive.  
- The plans it creates to achieve tasks are well-structured, which is why the end results are so good.  

Bad:  
- It's slow, but I guess they can scale.  
- It could use a longer context window, which would help a lot. It broke in between due to context issues while working on coding tasks.  
- Sometimes, the second iteration doesn’t work as well, and it just gets stuck on web searches or certain tasks, making it difficult to take control.  
- The coding capabilities are good but still behind Sonnet 3.7.  

Considering this is still in beta and already performing at this level, they can improve and solve a few issues, and it’ll be a heck of a product.

ManusAI vs. OpenAI DeepResearch

Disclaimer: I have not received any payment from ManusAI. The tests are completely objective. Thankfully, I receive numerous pre-accesses. I often don't have time to test everything. But by chance I gave Manus a chance. And I am positively impressed. In short: the test reflects my initial opinion and is not tainted by monetary payments or the like.

I am currently running further tests to see if ManusAI or DeepResearch from OpenAI is a better ResearchAgent. Unfortunately, Manus is still quite buggy and a query takes at least 30 minutes.

I am currently testing both models against each other with the following question:

“I want you to do an in-depth analysis of what the future of Artificial Intelligence is on the one hand and when we can expect it on the other. I would like you to examine when we can expect artificial general intelligence, what impact it will have on societies and people, and in different time frames. Once in the next 1-3 years, then 3-5, then 5-10 and 10-20 years. However, you should not only include artificial general intelligence, but also the possibility of superintelligence. Who is talking about superintelligence? What does that mean? Anthropics CEO Dario Amodai, for example, often writes in his blogs about superintelligence in 2026 or 2027. What does that mean? Especially in comparison to human history, such as the industrial revolution. Will it be just as big, bigger? How will the future develop?”

As soon as I have the results of both models, I will show them to you so that you can compare them yourself.

But what I found to be the “aha” effect of ManusAI in the first tests was its proactive approach. It creates things for me that I didn't ask for, but which it thinks are helpful.

For example, when I asked it to treat an illness, it created a meal plan for me with anti-inflammatory foods for almost a whole week - and it did this on its own, without asking (28 pages analysis!). That is absolutely crazy and positively surprised me. Overall, the results so far have been very in-depth, and even the most specific requests for real estate in my area have been delivered to the exact district (Germany). The data was up to date and correct! Great. Not only parks, playgrounds but also schools and much more were included in the evaluation. Ratings that even I hadn't thought of.
It's too early to declare a winner right now. But my first initial tests give me the feeling that it is significantly better than OpenAI. ManusAI is more human, more creative, more forward-thinking. It practically thinks for you!
As soon as I have enough results, I'll share them with you.

China’s Manus vs U.S’s OpenAI
(I don’t have access, this is early users review)

Manus AI Agent:
- handles real world workflows
- few bugs and slow
- but outperforms OpenAI’s deepresearch 
- have 12.2% edge on the GAIA benchmark
- interrupts and modifies tasks mid-execution
con: It lives upto the hype

Manus AI is a general AI agent designed to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously, making it highly versatile across various applications. 

Strengths:
Task Automation: Manus excels at automating workflows such as travel planning, financial analysis, and educational content creation, freeing users from tedious tasks.
Adaptability: It integrates multiple AI models to execute diverse tasks, from resume screening to stock analysis, offering tailored solutions based on user preferences.
Efficiency: Manus operates asynchronously in the cloud, allowing users to log off while tasks are completed, and it showcases impressive benchmarks in productivity and decision-making.

Weaknesses:
Dependence on External Models: Critics note that Manus relies heavily on external AI models like Anthropic's Claude rather than proprietary technology.
Scalability Issues: Early adopters have reported server instability and limitations in accessing external files.
Room for Improvement: Challenges like model hallucination and inconsistent aesthetics remain areas for refinement.

Manus is particularly useful in industries requiring data analysis, task management, and creative problem-solving, making it ideal for professionals in business, education, and personal productivity.
